              <blockquote class="synopsis">Per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Bake_Off">Wikipedia</a>, the Great British Bake Off (often referred to as Bake Off or GBBO) is
                a British television baking competition produced by Love Productions, in which a group of amateur bakers compete against each other in a series of rounds, attempting to impress
                a group of judges with their baking skills, with a contestant being eliminated in each round, with the winner being selected from the remaining contestants that make it to the
                finals. </blockquote>

        <div id="tabs-1">
          <p>In each episode, the amateur bakers are given three challenges: a signature bake, a technical challenge, and a show-stopper. The three challenges take place over two days, and the filming
             takes up to 16 hours a day. The contestants are assessed by the judges who then choose a "Star Baker" for the week, and a contestant is also eliminated. In the final round, three bakers are
             left and a winner is chosen from the three.</p>
             <h3>Signature Challenge</h3>
                <p>This challenge is for the amateur bakers to show off their tried-and-tested recipes for bakes they might make for their friends and family.</p>
              <h3>Technical Challenge</h3>
                <p>This challenge requires enough technical knowledge and experience to produce a certain finished product when given only limited – or even minimal – instructions. The bakers are all given the
              same recipe and are not told beforehand what the challenge will be. The finished products are judged blind and ranked from worst to best.</p>
              <h3>Showstopper Challenge</h3>
                <p>This challenge is for the bakers to show off their skills and talent. The judges favour a bake that has a professional appearance but is also outstanding in flavours.</p>

          <p> Biscuits. Baking. Classy music, and everyone is nice to one another unlike American competitive cooking shows which are all fire and brimstone. Although I do enjoy binging Cutthroat Kitchen.</p>

        <div id="tabs-3">
          <p>The show has become a significant part of British culture and is credited with spurring an interest in home baking, with supermarkets and department stores in the UK reporting sharp rises
            in sales of baking ingredients and accessories. It was also credited with reviving the Women's Institute, whose membership reached its highest level since the 1970s. The show also boosted the
            sales of bakery books and the number of baking clubs, and independent bakeries also showed an increase. According to one analyst, more than three-fifths of adults have baked at home at least once
            in 2013 compared with only a third in 2011.</p>
